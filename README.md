# BLM_Twitter_Project
The project entails a sentiment classifcation of 1.75 million BLM tweets.
Classifying these tweets with either a positive or negative sentiment allows researchers to view the context of how Black Lives Matter is viewed publicly.
Specifically, it allows researchers to see how vitriolic the twitterverse is when it comes to controversial movements.

This repository contains the code to recreate the word embeddings, conduct downstream transfer learning, create validation tests, and label BLM twitter data.
To access the embeddings, the training data files, and the labeled BLM data, view my website: https://mawalz05.wixsite.com/website/research
